As of now this repository is not setup as a tutorial, instead think of it as a reference and a guide. Most of the commands documented in this repository have `man` pages that are most likeley allready on your \*nix system. `man` pages will allways be a better refernce than this repository, however they are not allways a good starting point. The intention of these docs is to provide you with an abbreviated but powerful starting reference to each of the commands listed, as well as tips on when you might want to use them.  

Eventual I hope to write a short interative tutorial series that will demonstrate how to use these commands as developer tools. I find that most of the tutorials about working in the _shell_ often teach users only to think of the shell as a tool for controling the computer. The intenion for this project is expand on that and teach users to think of the shell as a powerful developer environment. To be more clear; on using the shell to write, edit, test, build, run, and automate any task to make development more fun and much faster!
