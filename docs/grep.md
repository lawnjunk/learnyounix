# grep
> search lines for a matching regular expression  

`grep <flags> <search term> <optional file paths>`

Grep is used to search lines for a matching regular expression. You can use it to search files for occurrences of a pattern, for example look for the file that that defines a class. You can use it to filter the output of another program, for example to filter the output of the `history` command for the times you used `curl` . Grep prints out the lines that match a PATTERN, and the filename if any.

## important flags
* `-i` ignore case
* `-r` recursively
* `-n` show line numbers
* `-E` regular expression
* `-v` invert match (selected lines are those **not** matching the pattern)
* `-w` look for entire pattern intact
* `-c` count occurrences

## examples
``` sh
# search a directory for a files that contain the PATTERN 'class Admin('

$ grep 'class Admin(' ./*
```
``` sh
# filter the output of the history command to print lines with 'curl'

$ history |grep 'curl'
```
``` sh
# filter the output of ifconfig to print my local IPv4 but not loopback
# used -w so that 'inet' matches but not 'inet6'

$ ifconfig |grep -w 'inet' |  grep -v '127.0.0.1'
```
